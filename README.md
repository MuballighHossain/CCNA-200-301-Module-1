    2) Network Models: Learning about the OSI and TCP/IP models.
    3) IP Addressing: Introduction to IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, and CIDR.
    4) Network Devices: Exploring the roles of routers, switches, and other networking devices.
    5) Data Transmission: Understanding how data is transmitted over networks, including concepts like bandwidth and latency.
    6) Ethernet Technologies: Basics of Ethernet and how local area networks (LANs) operate.
    7) Network Security: Introduction to basic security concepts and practices.
