Exploring the foundations of networking with CCNAv7 Module 1: from understanding network models to grasping essential protocols, I've gained insights into how data flows, the importance of IP addressing, and the role of networking devices.
Early in May of 2024, I enrolled in the CCNAv7: Introduction to Networks. I learned the following topics from my classes at AIUB Institute of Continuing Education:
Networking Fundamentals: Understanding what networks are and their components.
Network Models: Learning about the OSI and TCP/IP models.
IP Addressing: Introduction to IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, and CIDR.
Network Devices: Exploring the roles of routers, switches, and other networking devices.
Data Transmission: Understanding how data is transmitted over networks, including concepts like bandwidth and latency.
Ethernet Technologies: Basics of Ethernet and how local area networks (LANs) operate.
Network Security: Introduction to basic security concepts and practices.
Wireless Networking: Overview of wireless technologies and protocols.
